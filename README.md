With this plugin you can create some mob farms and other machines in a much more compact design.


# Crafting

All recipes are shapeless i.e. you can throw the items into the crafting table as you like.

MobKiller can be crafted with a hopper and a diamond sword.

For the MobSorter there are some versions for some mobs, you can craft them like this:
Creeper: Piston and gunpowder
Zombie: Piston and rotten flesh
Skeleton: Piston and bone
Enderman: Piston and ender pearl
Zombie Pigman: Piston and gold nugget
Witch: Piston and a potion
Villager: Piston and emerald

if a mob steps on one of the pressure plates the corresponding action will be executed.

# TODO
